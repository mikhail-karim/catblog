# :cat: Dummy Cat Blog Site :cat: 

![Main Page Screenshot.](C:\laragon\www\catblog\src\screenshot.png)

What I made here is a simple website using php that tests out a couple APIs in the form of a cat blogging site

The main thing this site does is giving out random cat pics and cat facts everytime it refreshes

Here are the APIs used:
- [Random Cat Pictures](https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search)
- [Random Cat Facts](https://catfact.ninja/fact)
- [Dummy User](https://dummyjson.com/users)
- [Random Profile Pic](https://randomuser.me/api/)

Try it for yourself! :cat2: :black_cat: :cat: :black_cat:

Known Bugs:
